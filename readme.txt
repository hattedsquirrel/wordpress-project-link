Shows an image next to a heading and a short descriptive text

== Description ==

Shows an image in the left side and a title + description on the right side. I use this to create a list
of my externaly hosted projects and link to them. This makes especially sense if you host software projects
on git and have a documentation over there.
It's similar in function to wordpress' "Media and Text" but adheres to the width and other stylistic
properties of your overall page design. The function is limited to what it is, you can't add more blocks on
your own. This can be easily changed in the source code, though ("templateLock").

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/hsq-project-link` directory, or install the plugin
   through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
